You can use it to:
* Dump cartridges, so you can play copy of your cartridge on emulator
* Read/write battery backed saves, so you can continue your saved game on emulator/console
* Write special cartridges like [COOLGIRL](https://github.com/ClusterM/coolgirl-famicom-multicard)
* Rewrite ultracheap chinese COOLBOY cartridges. Soldering is required for old versions but it's very simple. New versions can be rewrited without soldering
* Test your cartridges
* Read and frite Famicom Disk System cards using FDS drive with RAM adapter
* Some reverse engineering
* Anything else that requires Famicom bus simulation
